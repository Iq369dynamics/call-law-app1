## Customization

### Colors
The website uses a professional blue color scheme. To customize colors, modify the Tailwind CSS classes in `App.jsx` or update the theme in `tailwind.config.js`.

### Content
Update text content directly in `App.jsx`. The component uses hardcoded data for coverage options and blog posts that can be easily modified.

### Images
Replace images in the `src/assets/` directory. Update import paths in `App.jsx` if you add new images.

### Styling
Global styles are in `src/index.css` and `src/App.css`. Component-specific styles use Tailwind CSS classes.

## Deployment

### Deploy to Manus
```bash
# The website can be deployed using the Manus platform
